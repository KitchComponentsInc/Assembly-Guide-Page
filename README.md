# Assembly-Guide-Page
Go to the Shopify Portal for Kitch, then Online Store > Pages > assembly-guide. In the editor for the page, locate a button that looks like "<>". This shows the HTML for the webpage. You can also add CSS and JavaScript. Select all of the code and replace it with the new code you made. Or make edits directly in the code editor on shopify. Just remember to take that code and update it in this file, too, to keep track of everything.

Preview the page and make sure it all works and you're good to go.
