# Assembly-Guide-Page
Go to the Shopify Portal for Kitch, then Online Store > Pages > assembly-guide. In the editor for the page, locate a button that looks like "<>". This shows the HTML for the webpage. You can also add CSS and JavaScript. Select all of the code and replace it with the new code you made. It's easier to replace all of it instead of making small edits because the code may not load if the code has been edited.

Preview the page and make sure it all works and you're good to go.
