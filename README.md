# Assembly-Guide-Page
index.html contains all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the Assembly Guides Page. 

To make changes, first copy and paste the current file in the "Older Versions" folder. It's important to keep these in case the new code breaks.

To make any changes, open the new file in a text editor like Sublime Text, VS Code, or even Notepad if you don't need the visual help of a code editor. Make your desired modifications to the code within and save. If making changes isn't working, make sure the workspace trusts the window.

To make edits to this file, you must open it in a text editor like Notepad or Visual Studio Code, save it, then wait a few seconds (possibly minutes) and refresh the page. 

Go to the Shopify Portal for Kitch, then Online Store > Pages > assembly-guide. In the editor for the page, locate a button that looks like "<>". This shows the HTML for the webpage. You can also add CSS and JavaScript. Select all of the code and replace it with the new code you made. It's easier to replace all of it instead of making small edits because the code may not load if the code has been edited.

Preview the page and make sure it all works and you're good to go.
